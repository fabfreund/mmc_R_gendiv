R scripts to simulate genetic diversity under multiple merger (and other) coalescents and perform ABC inference of the genealogy model based on SNP data 

Code by F. Freund and A. Siri-Jégousse

The repository includes code we used for our manuscript "Distinguishing coalescent models - which statistics matter most?", availabe on biorxiv <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/679498v1>

We thank [Bjarki Eldon (Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin)](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~eldon/index.html) for allowing us to share his code here for computing the expected branch lengths for Kingman's n-coalescent with exponential growth
